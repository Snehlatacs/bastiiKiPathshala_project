# HopeHands - React + Tailwind NGO Starter

## What is included
- Vite + React app
- Tailwind CSS configured
- Components: Hero, About, Volunteer Form
- Responsive layout (mobile-first)

## Quick start
1. Extract the zip.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Run dev server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Deploy
- For GitHub Pages: build (`npm run build`) and follow GitHub Pages instructions (or use `gh-pages`).
- For Netlify / Vercel: connect your repo and deploy â€” both detect Vite projects automatically.

## Notes
This is a frontend-only starter. To accept volunteer submissions in production, connect `VolunteerForm` to a backend API or use a service like Formspree / Netlify Forms.
